# Cbp Core integration/staging repository


Cbp Quark (CBP) is an open-source privacy focused digital


currency based on Bitcoins blockchain technology, Dash’ Masternodes


and Zerocoin’s Zerocash protocol, combining them to create a powerfully


innovative technology. Cbp Quark is also powered by Blackcoin


Proof-of-Stake 3.0 and Bitcoin core 0.10x code base using Quark


hashing algorithm with a block time of just 120 seconds.


A peer-to-peer digital currency that provides fast, zero cost payments to


anywhere around the world without any third-party intervention. Cbp


Quark is a fully decentralized global payment network allowing


individuals to have full control of their finances.


Masternodes require a collateral of 10,000 CBP and can be run on the


Tor network for greater privacy. All transactions on the network are fully


verifiable with a built-in blockchain explorer within the software itself. The


reward ratio of staking to masternodes is 70:30.
